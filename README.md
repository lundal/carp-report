## Cellular Automata Research Platform Report

This repository contains the report that will become my master thesis for the Cellular Automata Research Platform developed at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

It is currently work in progress, and will likely change and break often.

The PCIe communication module was developed as a separate project.
The report for it can be found in the legacy branch.
