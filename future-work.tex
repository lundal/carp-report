\TODO Com buffer checks!

\subsection{Rewrite everything}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Simplify design (large complex pipelined modules atm)
    \item Increase modularity
    \item Get rid of tristate buffers
    \item Get rid of remains from having two clock domains
    \item Get rid of reset (ug687 page 54, wp272 page 5)
    \item Reduce BRAM bandwidth requirements (also bram A -> dev -> bram B)
    \item Use generics instead of global constants
    \item Unify 2D and 3D designs
    \item Add instruction that reports info (2D/3D, SIZE, ++)
    \item Revert to 32bit based instructions (since PCIe)
    \item Not just pow2 sizes
    \item Add general purpose counters
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Maybe}

\begin{itemize}
    \item DMA (better performance?)
    \item Toggle SBM wrap-around
\end{itemize}
