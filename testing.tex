\subsection{Bugs fixed}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Writing states/types to BRAM (unsupported splicing of signals)
    \item Development running infinitely (comparison of parameterized signal with constant)
    \item WriteRule-3D not following spec (up/down swapped with north/south)
    \item PrintTypes (wrong offsets)
    \item ReadVector/PrintVector still 32-bit
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bugs remaining}

\begin{itemize}
    \item ReadStates prints extra zeroes at beginning (buffering error)
    \item ReadRuleVector sends an extra word the first time, every word thereafter is offset by one
    \item ReadUsedRules does not work when width = 8 (simulator crashes: ERROR: Index 63 out of bound 31 downto 0)
    \item Development stores previous state/type to bram. Rules does not get triggered
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Instructions (3D)}

\subsubsection{Working}

\begin{itemize}
    \item clearBRAM
    \item readState
    \item readType
    \item switch
    \item writeState
    \item writeType
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Not working}

\begin{itemize}
    \item devstep
    \item readStates
    \item readRuleVector
    \item readUsedRules
\end{itemize}
