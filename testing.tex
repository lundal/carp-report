\subsection{Bugs fixed}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Writing states/types to BRAM (unsupported splicing of signals)
    \item Development running infinitely (comparison of parameterized signal with constant)
    \item WriteRule-3D not following spec (up/down swapped with north/south)
    \item PrintTypes (wrong offsets)
    \item ReadVector/PrintVector still 32-bit
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bugs remaining}

\begin{itemize}
    \item ReadStates prints extra zeroes at beginning (buffering error)
    \item ReadRuleVector prints least significant bits one extra time (buffering error?)
    \item Development stores previous state/type to bram
\end{itemize}
