\todo{rewrite this}

EHW research has been performed at NTNU for a long time.
In 2003 a CA research platform was created on an FPGA
It was based on a matrix sblocks, and has later been expanded.

In expectiation of new hardware (larger FPGA, PCI Express), Støvneng recently updated and optimized the platform.
He also extended the sblockmatrix into 3D and added DFT.
The hardware did not arrive, therefore communication was not updated, and things were only tested in simulation.

The purpose of this project is to finish the platform so that it can be used for research.
The first thing is to replace the old PCI communication module with one for PCI Express.
The second is to verify that Støvnengs updates works when implemented on the hardware.

Hardware could not be delivered, so used SP605 instead, which has a smaller FPGA.

The communication unit and software interface is implemented.
Verification shows the existing design has a lot of issues.
