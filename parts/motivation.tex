Self-replication, co-processors, new cpu architectures,

Currently, CARP is only usable in simulations, which are extremely slow and therefore practically unusable.
Implementing a PCI Express communication unit should make the new platform operational, allowing it to be used for research.

The new platform is about 4 times faster than the old and support larger sblock matrices.
It also has the new and exciting DFT, which is shown to produce very useful data.
3D is also exiting as it allows much more complex communication pathways to form within the CA.

Verification of previous modifications are necessary since it was only tested in simulation.
The path from a behavioral description to an implementation using LUTs and FFs is long and complex; what functions in simulation does not necessarily function when implemented.
