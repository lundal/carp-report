\todo{motivations for having a CA research platform}

\todo{rewrite this}

Currently, CARP is only usable in simulations.
They are extremely slow, so it is practically unusable.

Implementing communication should make the new platform operational, allowing it to be used for research.
The new platform is about 4 times faster than the old and support larger sblock matrices.
It also has the new and exciting DFA, which is shown to produce very useful data.
3D is also exiting as it allows much more complex communication pathways inside the CA.

Verification of previous modifications are necessary since it was only tested in simulation.
What works in simulation does not necessarily work in implementation.
