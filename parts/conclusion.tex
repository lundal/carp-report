In this paper, a new hardware platform has been set up.
A PCI Express communication unit has been designed and implemented in hardware.
A corresponding api has been created in software.
It has all been successfully integrated into the the existing platform.

Unfortunately, verification shows that the recently upgraded design has a lot of issues.
Some issues could be fixed within the alotted time, but several critical remain.
Neither the sblock matrix nor the development unit is functional, which means the platform is currently unusable.
These issues along with a long list of proposed changes suggest that a major rewrite might be in order.
